## Under the hood
Whole plugin is a tiny bash script wrapper around Git commands. An idea is to have a Git repository at user's home directory and whitelist only a specific files and directories to keep a track on. In order to achieve that plugin relies on a special file named `.gitinclude`. `.gitinclude` is used to achieve exactly the same behaviour as with `.gitignore`, except it contains a whitelist of all FS paths.
